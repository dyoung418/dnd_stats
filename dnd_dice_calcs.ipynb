    "- Add argument for a flat dmg modifier that is added some percentage of the time (e.g. rage damage bonus)\n",
    "- Add arguments for half-proficiency and double-proficiency in the ability check function\n",
    "- Do a chart which shows the percentage point benefit from advantage, and then a chart which translates that to a +modifier that you get from advantage.  For example a check against a DC 13 challenge has a 40% chance of succeeding (ignoring criticals for now).  At advantage, that check has a 64% chance of succeeding (for a 24 ppt gain).  That translates into a +5 roll equivalent which is ceiling(0.24/0.05, ceiling_accuracy) where I used ceiling_accuracy at 0.25 to round to the next highest quarter of a point modifier."
